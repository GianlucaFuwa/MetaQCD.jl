AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIATION:
- Either use ChainRulesCore or try Enzyme if possible
- Should create "SU(3)" and "su(3)" types to define different rrules
- Create rrule for cmatmul and any function that uses an Abstractfield as input
- Dont know how loops are handled yet
    Update 20.01.24:
    - Enzyme seems to work up to daggering. Using "Daggered" wrapper is pain in the ass
    - Normal adjoint "'" breaks the AD for some reason

GPU:
- Fields are going to have to be 5-dimensional CuArrays
- Reduction still iffy with KernelAbstractions
- Shared memory optimization is a headache---memory on 1060 only 48kb, only enough for 2^4
    + halo at 32bit precision---should be better on more powerful GPUs, maybe ask
    Lukas if he has worked with GPUs in 4D-SU(3)
- Still have to figure out if all indices are being looped over

CACHE FRIENDLINESS:
- Split lattice into blocks that fit on L2-Cache
- Making lattice itself more cache local is hard 
- Could try using OffsetArrays to avoid the "mod1()" calls in move
- Stencils are small enough that all matrices and sites fit into L1
